# Why I used this technologies?
* With Bootstrap is just amazing all you can do whitout typing a single line of code of CSS, I love vanilla CSS but right now I'm looking to be more familiarized with bootstrap and I'm really looking to hadle it profesionally. Is amazing all you can do with NodeJS, I would like to keep practicing  with node in order to use the different packages, in this project I'm jus using inquirer and the fs library, but I'm learning express also and this project is being a huge step in knowlege for my carrer.

# Challenges
* It is amazing how you can modularize the code in different modules so you can have a more clean code, so, it was a little tricky learn how you can divide the code in the different modules and how it's the best way to do it. Also I love to work with OPP, a think it allows us to reutilize our code every time we need to, and it's amazing how much code we save to write or re-write. The TDD part is always important, I'm learning how to to TDD and I think it push you  not  only to develop a much clean and mantainable code but to develop your logic as every good developer.
